# Metropolitan Property Value Prognostication

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting property values in a metropolitan area. By analyzing features such as area type, availability, location, size, society, total square footage, number of bathrooms, number of balconies, and price, this project aims to build a predictive model that can assist in estimating property prices for potential buyers and sellers.

## Introduction

The real estate market in metropolitan areas is highly dynamic and often presents challenges in accurately estimating property values. This project leverages data-driven techniques to predict property prices based on various property attributes. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist individuals in making informed real estate decisions.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

- Area Type: The type of area (e.g., Super built-up, Built-up, Plot Area).
- Availability: Availability status of the property.
- Location: Location of the property in the metropolitan area.
- Size: Size of the property in terms of rooms/bedrooms.
- Society: Name of the housing society, if applicable.
- Total Square Footage: Total area of the property in square feet.
- Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the property.
- Balconies: Number of balconies in the property.
- Price: Price of the property.


## Analysis

The analysis process encompasses:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** This phase involves understanding the distribution of property attributes, identifying outliers, and exploring potential correlations between features.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Transformations and encoding techniques are applied to prepare the data for model training.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and categorical features are encoded.

## Prediction Model

A machine learning model is trained to predict property prices based on the provided features. Various regression algorithms are experimented with, and the best-performing model is chosen.

## Results

The project aims to achieve the following outcomes:

- A predictive model capable of estimating property values with reasonable accuracy.
- Insights into the importance of different features in determining property prices.
- A better understanding of how property attributes relate to pricing trends.

These outcomes can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the metropolitan real estate market.
